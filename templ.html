<h2><a class="anchor" id="executive-summary"></a>Executive Summary</h2>

The dataset, covering the period from January 2021 to December 2021, consists of approximately 39,000 records across 24
variables. During this time, a total of 38.6K loan applications were received, with an overall funded amount of USD
435.8 million. In comparison, the total amount received stood at USD 473.1 million, resulting in a surplus of USD 37.3
million, which is about 8.6% higher than the funded amount. This surplus highlight additional financial flexibility and
lowers funding risk. Furthermore, the loans carried an average interest rate of 13.5%, reflecting the overall lending
landscape during the year.

From a structural perspective, 60-month loans dominate the portfolio, making up 62.3% of the amount received, while
36-month loans account for 37.7%. By loan purpose, Debt Consolidation is the largest category ($0.25B), followed by
Credit Card ($0.07B) and Home Improvement ($0.04B). Recovery on bad loans is relatively robust at 57%, with $37.3M
collected against $65.5M funded, though this results in a loss given default (LGD) of $28.2M. The gross portfolio yield
stands at 8.6%, reflecting a profitable and growing loan book, though risk concentration in long-tenor loans and
specific purposes creates vulnerabilities

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Effective loan portfolio management is critical for sustaining profitability and reducing risk in the banking and
financial industry. Banks must ensure they are not incurring losses due to high default rates, risky borrower profiles,
or inefficient lending practices.
The objective of this project is to analyze the bank‚Äôs loan portfolio in order to identify key factors influencing
borrower repayment behavior and loan defaults. By examining borrower characteristics such as debt-to-income ratio,
annual income, credit grade, loan term, and loan purpose, good loan vs bad loan. The analysis aims to uncover risk
patterns and performance trends. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that enable the bank to strengthen
credit risk management, minimize default rates, and enhance overall profitability through data-driven decision-making.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-portfolio--insights"></a>Key Portfolio Insights</h2>

**Loan Status**
The loan status distribution provides further insight into portfolio health. Currently, there are 1,098 active loans
with $18.9M funded and $24.2M received. Charged-off loans total 5,333, with $65.5M funded and $37.3M received. Fully
paid loans are the majority at 32,145, representing $351.4M funded and $411.6M received. This equates to a default rate
of 13.8% by count.

---

**Risk Drivers**

The primary drivers of risk are longer-tenor loans, borrowers with higher DTI ratios, and riskier purposes such as small
business and unsecured ‚Äúother‚Äù categories. Borrowers with DTI above 15% represent elevated risk and should be managed
with stricter eligibility or higher pricing.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="segmentation-insights"></a>Segmentation Insights</h2>

**By Purpose**

Debt Consolidation dominates receipts but poses concentration risk. If underwriting weakens, defaults could increase
significantly. Credit Card and Home Improvement loans are secondary contributors but also warrant close monitoring.

---

**By Employment Length**

Borrowers with stable employment histories, particularly 10+ years, show stronger repayment performance, contributing
$126M in receipts. Borrowers with less than 1 year of tenure are riskier and should be subject to tighter underwriting.

---

**By Term**

Long-term (60-month) loans account for the majority of receipts but create greater duration and LGD risk compared to
36-month loans. Shifting a portion of growth to shorter terms can mitigate these risks.

---

<h2><a class="anchor" id="trend-analysis"></a>Trend Analysis</h2>

**Growth overview**
Loan receipts have shown a significant upward trajectory over the year, starting at $28M in January and rising to $58M
in December. This represents an absolute increase of $30M and a percentage growth of approximately 107% year-on-year. In
other words, receipts more than doubled within the twelve-month period.

---

**Monthly Growth Rate**

The compounding monthly growth rate across this period is estimated at 6.3%. At this pace, receipts could potentially
double every 12 months if sustained, underscoring the strong momentum within the portfolio.


**Seasonal Patterns**

There is evidence of seasonality in the data. Receipts remained modest in the first quarter ($28M‚Äì$32M), reflecting a
slower lending cycle after the holiday season. However, inflows increased consistently throughout the year, with the
highest volumes in the fourth quarter ($49M‚Äì$58M), aligning with higher borrowing and spending activity during the
holiday and year-end period.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="recommendations-for--management"></a>Recommendations for Management</h2>

**Tighten Risk Controls:** Limit 60-month exposures within each purpose and set stricter eligibility criteria for
high-risk segments.

**Dynamic Pricing:** Implement grade-by-purpose price floors to achieve an 80‚Äì150 basis point uplift on riskier categories.

**Collections Improvement:** Enhance collections processes to lift bad-loan recovery rates from 57% to at least 62%, adding
an estimated $3.3M in incremental receipts.

**Approval Discipline:** Monitor approval rates and post-funding delinquency by channel, pausing underperforming channels.

**Scorecard Refresh:** Re-weight key features such as DTI, employment length, purpose, and term to improve predictive
accuracy by 3‚Äì5%.
